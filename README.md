# Global Bans

Global Bans is a system designed to manage and enforce bans for users across multiple platforms or services. It provides a centralized database of banned users, their ban details, and associated punishments. The Global Bans system allows administrators to track and share ban information, ensuring consistent enforcement of penalties across different platforms or services.

## Features

- **Ban Details**: The system records various details related to bans, such as ban status, reason, expiration date, and the administrator who issued the ban.
- **Ban History**: Global Bans maintains a comprehensive history of bans for each user, allowing administrators to review past infractions and track user behavior.
- **API Integration**: The system provides an API for easy integration with other applications, allowing developers to access and utilize ban information programmatically.
